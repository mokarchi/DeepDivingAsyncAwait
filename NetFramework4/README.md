It serves as the core building block for the Task Parallel Library (TPL) introduced in .NET Framework 4.0.The key points about tasks from the article:

1. Creating and starting tasks: Tasks can be created and started using the `Task.Run` method, which queues the task for execution and returns a `Task` object representing the ongoing operation. The action to be executed can be provided as a `Action` delegate or a `Func` delegate for tasks that return a result.
2. Waiting for tasks: The `Task.Wait` method can be used to wait for a task to complete. It has overloads that allow waiting for a specific timeout or waiting for any of an array of tasks to complete.
3. Task cancellation: Tasks can be canceled using the `CancellationToken` and `CancellationTokenSource` classes. By passing a `CancellationToken` to the `Task.Run` method and monitoring the token's `IsCancellationRequested` property within the task's action, you can cancel a task and handle the cancellation request.
4. Task continuation: The `Task.ContinueWith` method allows you to specify an action to be executed when a task completes, regardless of whether it completed successfully, was canceled, or encountered an exception. This enables powerful composition of asynchronous operations.
5. Exception handling: Unhandled exceptions in tasks are propagated when waiting for the task or getting its result, allowing you to handle exceptions in a centralized location.
